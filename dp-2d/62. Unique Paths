Time O(m × n) (2D DP)
Space O(n) (1D optimized)

    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = 1
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[j] += dp[j-1]

        return dp[-1]

How can we reach (i, j)?
The robot can only move:
- Down → from (i-1, j)
- Right → from (i, j-1)
So the recurrence is:
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
