class Solution:
    def minSideJumps(self, obstacles: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [1, 0, 1] # Frog starts on lane 2 with 0 side jumps

        for i in range(1, len(obstacles)):
            obs = obstacles[i]
            if obs != 0:
                dp[obs-1] = float("inf")
            
            best = min(dp)
            for j in range(3):
                if obstacles[i] != j+1: # lane is open
                    dp[j] = min(dp[j], best+1)

        return min(dp)


Start (point 0)
Frog starts on lane 2 with 0 side jumps:
- lane 2: 0
- lane 1 and 3: 1 (one side jump from lane 2 at point 0)
So:
dp = [1, 0, 1]   # lanes 1,2,3

If obstacles[i] == l, then lane l is impossible:
dp[l-1] = INF

relax side jumps within the same point
If you’re at point i, you can side-jump to another lane (same point) with cost +1.
So for each lane l that is not blocked:
dp[l] = min(dp[l], 1 + min(dp[other two lanes]))
