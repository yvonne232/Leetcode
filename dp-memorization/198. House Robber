class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        rob1, rob2 = 0,0
        for n in nums:
            temp = max(n+rob1, rob2)
            rob1 = rob2
            rob2 = temp
        
        return rob2

For houses:
...  [i-2]  [i-1]  [i]
If you rob [i], [i-1] must be skipped
⇒ last safe state is [i-2]
So
1. Skip it
money = prev1
2. Rob it
money = prev2 + nums[i]
